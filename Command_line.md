**Command Line**

Congratulations! You’ve learned five commands commonly used to navigate the filesystem from the command line. What can we generalize so far?

The command line is a text interface for the computer’s operating system. 

To access the command line, we use the **terminal**.

A filesystem organizes a computer’s files and directories into a tree structure. It starts with the root directory. 

Each parent directory can contain more child directories and files.

From the command line, you can navigate through files and folders on your computer:

-**pwd** outputs the name of the current working directory.

-**ls** lists all files and directories in the working directory.

-**cd** switches you into the directory you specify.

-**mkdir** creates a new directory in the working directory.

-**touch** creates a new file inside the working directory.
