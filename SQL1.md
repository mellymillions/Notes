Querying a basic database using 'AND', 'OR':
```sql
CREATE TABLE songs (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    title TEXT,
    artist TEXT,
    mood TEXT,
    duration INTEGER,
    released INTEGER);
    
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Bohemian Rhapsody", "Queen", "epic", 60, 1975);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Let it go", "Idina Menzel", "epic", 227, 2013);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will survive", "Gloria Gaynor", "epic", 198, 1978);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Twist and Shout", "The Beatles", "happy", 152, 1963);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("La Bamba", "Ritchie Valens", "happy", 166, 1958);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("I will always love you", "Whitney Houston", "epic", 273, 1992);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Sweet Caroline", "Neil Diamond", "happy", 201, 1969);
INSERT INTO songs (title, artist, mood, duration, released)
    VALUES ("Call me maybe", "Carly Rae Jepsen", "happy", 193, 2011);
    
SELECT title FROM songs;

SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" OR released > 1990;

SELECT title FROM songs WHERE mood = "epic" AND released >1990 AND duration <240;
```
Subqueries and 'IN':
```sql
CREATE TABLE exercise_logs
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    type TEXT,
    minutes INTEGER, 
    calories INTEGER,
    heart_rate INTEGER);

INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 30, 100, 110);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("biking", 10, 30, 105);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("dancing", 15, 200, 120);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("tree climbing", 30, 70, 90);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("tree climbing", 25, 72, 80);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("rowing", 30, 70, 90);
INSERT INTO exercise_logs(type, minutes, calories, heart_rate) VALUES ("hiking", 60, 80, 85);

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type = "biking" OR type = "hiking" OR type = "tree climbing" OR type = "rowing";

/* IN */
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN ("biking", "hiking", "tree climbing", "rowing");

CREATE TABLE drs_favorites
    (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    type TEXT,
    reason TEXT);

INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("biking", "Improves endurance and flexibility.");
INSERT INTO drs_favorites(type, reason) VALUES ("hiking", "Increases cardiovascular health.");

SELECT type FROM drs_favorites;

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites);
    
SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason = "Increases cardiovascular health");
    
/* LIKE */

SELECT * FROM exercise_logs WHERE type IN (
    SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE "%cardiovascular%");
```
Nested Queries:
```sql

SELECT * FROM songs WHERE artist IN ("Taylor Swift", "Rihanna", "Celine Dion", "Gloria Estefan");
