Here's how to calculate population standard deviation:

1. Calculate the mean of the data—this is \muμmu in the formula.
2. Subtract the mean from each data point. These differences are called deviations. Data points below the mean will have negative deviations, and data points above the mean will have positive deviations.
3.  Square each deviation to make it positive.
4.  Add the squared deviations together.
5. Divide the sum by the number of data points in the population. The result is called the variance.
6. Take the square root of the variance to get the standard deviation.

### Sample standard deviation

The equation is the same but with your sample data set.

5. Step five chagnes to: Divide by the sum by one less than the number of data points in the sample. The result is called the variance (n-1).
